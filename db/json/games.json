Interactive Entertainment, which takes place in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien\u0027s Legendarium. \n \nThe game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien\u0027s The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life. \n \nThe game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor. \n \nThe melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player\u0027s combo multiplier. \n \nA unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they\u0027re off screen. If the player does not kill an enemy in an encounter, this enemy will remember the player and change their tactics and conversations based on the encounter."

From a third-person perspective, players control Jodie through fully interactive environments, choosing a variety of action-, dialogue-, and decision-paths based on on-screen prompts. Some choices can lead to depictions of violence: Jodie attacking assailants with punches, kicks, and various objects (e.g., tree branches and knives; impaling an enemy with a pipe). As the character Aiden, players solve puzzles, manipulate objects and attack (e.g., strangulation) Jodie\u0027s assailants. Players can also use Aiden to possess enemies and perform violent acts (e.g., shooting fellow SWAT members; crashing vehicles; performing self-inflicted gunshot wounds). Some of these sequences are accompanied by blood-splatter effects. In one cutscene, a bound character\u0027s eye is cut out during an interrogation—the act is obscured by a character\u0027s back. One prolonged bar sequence depicts three men attempting to rape a woman; players control Aiden and interact with objects to stop the assailants. Another sequence depicts a character propositioning a woman to perform fellatio. The game includes depictions of the central character drinking beer and smoking a marijuana in a party setting – screen distortion occurs during theses sequences. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” can be heard in the dialogue."

    "summary": "Tekken 3 maintains the same core fighting system and concept as its predecessors, but brings many improvements, such as significantly more detailed graphics and animations, fifteen new characters added to the game\u0027s roster, more modern music and faster and more fluid gameplay. \nPerhaps the most noticeable change from Tekken 2 fight system is movement reform - whereas the element of depth had been largely insignificant in previous Tekken games (aside from some characters having unique sidesteps and dodging maneuvers), Tekken 3 added emphasis on the third axis, allowing all characters to sidestep in or out of the background by lightly pressing the arcade stick (or tapping the controller button in the console version) towards the corresponding direction. Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn\u0027t connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws. \n \nTekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat \u0027em up minigame called \"Tekken Force\", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first). This was continued in Tekken 4 and succeeded by the Devil Within minigame in Tekken 5 - but Boskonovitch was dropped as a playable character after Tekken 3. There is also a minigame \"Tekken Ball\", similar to beach volleyball, where one has to hit the ball with a powerful attack to hurt the opponent or try to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the ground in the opponent\u0027s area, thus causing damage."

The combat system is primarily the player using a wide variety of skills corresponding with the class against the monsters, who also have their own set of skills. The majority of the game is to simply attack and defeat the monsters along the way while partaking quests. The combat system is unique in a way that, although the player has to click on a monster to engage in combat, the player also has the ability to move to dodge and use their skills in a variety of ways. With an accompanying Eidolon, the player\u0027s Eidolon can also fight alongside their character, and also use a combination attack. The combat system is not merely a \"click-and-watch\" combat. Outside of the combat system, the player can also engage in several different tasks, such as fishing, crafting, and many more.\n\nWhile the game is situated in a free-to-play environment, the game also allows the players to purchase Aeria Points, or for short AP, that allows the players to use that monetary value for special in-game items found in the Item Mall. Otherwise, the game uses the gold and silver tactic, which can be acquired a number of ways. The game also allows the use of trade, a self-installed stall in Navea, and the Auction House.

    "summary": "Girls\u0027 Frontline is a moe anthropomorphism game in which the player controls echelons of android characters, known in-game as \"T-Dolls\" or \"Tactical Dolls\", each of which represents a real-world firearm. \n The player plays as a newly recruited commander of an area who commands the T-Dolls in battle, and organises the echelons as well as the T-Dolls\u0027 wellbeing. Battles are a mix of turn-based strategy puzzles on a set map with enemies that can move about, random item nodes and heliports/command nodes, from which the player can summon their own echelons, or support echelons, which are echelons that the player\u0027s friend sets on their profile to be used by others, and real-time battles with enemy echelons. Battles are for the most part automated, although the player can activate the T-Dolls\u0027 special abilities manually if wanted, or order them to different spots in formation (which the player can organise out of battle to be set as the default formation when entering a battle) or to withdraw in order to conserve health or resources). Players also have the option of withdrawing specific echelons from the mission altogether if they wish. Gameplay progresses by playing on the campaign missions, logistic support missions, or combat simulations to level up each T-Doll. The game also features gacha elements, such as in the production and heavy production of T-Dolls and equipment, or in the Dormitory with costumes and furniture sets for the T-Dolls on a time-limited basis with several sets and costumes being available for a limited time, before another few sets and costumes are revealed and added. After a while, old costumes from previous gacha events will be added to the \"Black Card\" store, where players can exchange an amount of Black Cards (obtained from gifting T-Dolls a duplicate costume that has already been gifted before) for a costume of a previous gacha set. Players can customise their dorms with furniture, and interact with Chibi renditions of the T-Dolls in the echelon corresponding with that dorm. They can also gift the T-Dolls food and costume, which raises the affection of the T-Dolls. Affection is also gained from success in battle, and is lost when the T-Dolls die (unless it is a boss battle) or when another T-Doll in the same echelon dies."

Eventually, the Balaur became obsessed with power and subjugation. Five of the Balaur rose to a height of strength above the rest, and became known as the five Dragon Lords. When Aion refused to grant them the power they desired, the power to rival his own, they revolted and declared war on the god that created them. Aion\u0027s hand was forced, and he created the twelve Empyrean Lords, beings of divinity and power to protect the Tower of Eternity. \n \nSome humans \"ascended\" to become Daeva and, like the Empyrean Lords, had wings and the ability to fight the Balaur. With time, enough Daevas rose to form an army. The Empyrean Lords would lead the Daeva into battle and fight ceaselessly. Eventually an attempt at peace with the Balaur was made. The five Drakan Lords were invited inside the barrier for peace talks, but before the peace-talks could begin, one of the Drakan Lords was nearly assassinated by an unknown assailant. In the fighting that followed, the Tower of Eternity was destroyed, resulting in the cataclysm that broke Atreia in half. Five Empyrean Lords, most of whom opposed the peace treaty, came to power in the dark part of the world, \"Asmodae,\" and became known as the Shedim Lords. Another five who had mostly desired peace became the Seraphim Lords and ruled over the lower half of Atreia, \"Elysea.\" Two of the Empyrean Lords sacrificed themselves to keep Atreia from crumbling entirely. \n \nThose that lived in the light part of the world, the Elyos, saw little change. These followers of the Seraphim Lords created the city of Sanctum. The inhabitants of the upper part, the Asmodians, saw many changes. Their hands became claw-like, their feet became talons. The darkness made their complexion cool, and their eyes grew red adapting to the absence of light. They live in the city of Pandaemonium under the rule of the Shedim Lords."

The only form of communication between the two is a musical chime. This chime also transforms dull, stiff pieces of cloth found throughout the levels into vibrant red, affecting the game world and allowing the player to progress through the levels. The robed figure wears a trailing scarf, which when charged by approaching floating pieces of cloth, briefly allows the player to float through the air.\n\nThe developers sought to evoke in the player a sense of smallness and wonder, and to forge an emotional connection between them and the anonymous players they meet along the way. The music, composed by Austin Wintory, dynamically responds to the player\u0027s actions, building a single theme to represent the game\u0027s emotional arc throughout the story. Reviewers of the game praised the visual and auditory art as well as the sense of companionship created by playing with a stranger, calling it a moving and emotional experience. Journey won several \"game of the year\" awards and received several other awards and nominations, including a Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media nomination for the 2013 Grammy Awards."

It was initially released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms on 17 May 2011; a Microsoft Windows port was later released on 8 November 2011. \n \nL.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player\u0027s success at these activities will impact how much of each case\u0027s story is revealed. \n \nThe game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir—stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity—along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes for its in-game cases, based upon what was reported by the Los Angeles media in 1947. \n \nThe game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as The Naked City, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential."
